Step into the Marvel universe like never before with our one-of-a-kind app. When you choose a character, you'll dive
into their world through their photo, name, and a detailed description. What's more, we've added the feature to search
for characters by name, enhancing your experience even further. On the technical side, this project is built using
Flutter, leveraging the robust BLoC state management. We've embraced a clean architecture, following a layered
structure, and adhered to the SOLID principles to ensure a robust and scalable codebase.
